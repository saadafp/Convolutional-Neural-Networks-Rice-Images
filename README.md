# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-Rice-Images
In this repo, I used CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) on Rice_Image dataset.
There are 2 notebooks in this repo(One with Pytorch and one with Tensorflow).
The source of the dataset is from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreenidhihipparagi/google-stock-prediction
